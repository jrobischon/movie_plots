2) Input : Brief description of a movie plot  
Output : Movies with plots similar to input plot

The project code consists of the following:

* get_data.py (scrapes movie data from Wikipedia)
* tests/tests.py (unit tests for get_data.py)
* notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
* notebooks/recommender.ipynb
